Hello I'm Mostafa Alsaddek 
========================================
To be able to run this app you need to 
- Open Appium server GUI then start session at 0.0.0.0:4723
- I use my Android mobile, so I connect it with USB cable and make USB debugging on from the developer settings
- Please change the following based on your phone
        cap.setCapability("appium:platformVersion", "14");
        cap.setCapability("appium:deviceName", "RKY-LX2");
        cap.setCapability("appium:udid", "A6NY9X3609G03187");
- I use Sauce Labs to be able to inspect the application elements as Appium inspector is not working with me, also UiAutomationViewer is not available in latest Android Studio app.
========================================
In this project, I use Eclipse, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit runner.

I make 2 scenarios
1- Invalid Logins
I implement 4 TCs like to show different messages per each case of inputs.

2- Valid Login
	- I Login to the home page
	- I assert the valid login

You can get the feature file in (src/test/java/mobileFeatures/SauceDemoMobile.feature)
	
As this is a Cucumber I create the step definition file in sdFiles package (src/main/java/sd) that contains the actions for each command in the feature file.

I use a local report after each run in HTML, you can find the test report in (target\cucumber-reports\cucumber-html-report.html)
========================================================================

To run this application you need to import the project to Eclipse then Go to the Runner file (src/test/java/runner/RunnerMobileTest.java) then run as "JUnit Test"

Note: I use Windows and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2024-09 (4.33.0)
